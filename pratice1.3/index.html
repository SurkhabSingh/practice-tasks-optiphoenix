      <h1>Standard Delivery</h1>
      <p>
        Orders guaranteed for Christmas shipping are for in stock items, ordered
        by Tuesday 20th December. Please allow 5-7 working days for delivery.
        Pre-ordered items will be sent as soon as possible after the date quoted
        and we'll generally ship your entire order with your pre-ordered items.
        When your order is dispatched, we'll send you another email with details
        of how to track it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most orders are sent on a fully-tracked courier service with Yodel. To
        avoid perishable items being stuck at depots and deteriorating, no
        signature is required, and our courier is asked to leave your order in a
        safe place on your property. We'll send a tracking link when we dispatch
        your order, so you know when it's due to arrive. Please note, once
        delivered we cannot be held responsible for loss or theft from your
        property. If you have any specific delivery instructions, please let us
        know - there's an option to enter a short message for the courier at the
        checkout.
      </p>
      <p>
        Smaller, lighter, single-item orders may be sent through the post with
        Royal Mail - in which case no tracking is available.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our experienced nursery team will always send your plants nursery fresh
        in the perfect condition to thrive when you plant them, so although most
        plants are very tough and will not be affected by all but the most
        extreme frosts or heatwaves, we avoid dispatching the most perishable
        plants if extreme weather is forecast, or over Bank Holiday weekends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note, we cannot guarantee delivery on a certain day or time.
        Delivery to outlying postcode areas may take 1-2 days longer, dependent
        on your location.
